      copy="The month-and-year title opens an in-place navigator with a 100-year runway in either direction. Compact sticky-year blocks place a left rail beside month grids containing only their labeled year: January and February lead, complete rows run through November, and December closes on its own row. Year labels and month names share a distinct, theme-coordinated alternating text tone. Virtualization keeps the mounted page small and settled edge loading prevents iPhone momentum from cascading. A month, chevron, or Start/End jump restores the same six-week date view without changing the selected period."
